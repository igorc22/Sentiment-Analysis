### :smile: Movie Sentiment Analysis :rage:

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including bag of words, lemmatization, word embeddings, and term frequency analysis. The focus is on applying machine learning classification methods to analyze and understand text data. Advanced techniques such as grid search, random search, and model tuning are employed to optimize the performance and accuracy of the machine learning models. The goal is to enhance the project's capability in extracting meaningful insights from textual data through sophisticated NLP and machine learning methodologies.
